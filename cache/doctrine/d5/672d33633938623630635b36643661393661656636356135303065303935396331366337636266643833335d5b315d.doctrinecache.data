    <h3>Team 2018</h3>
    <p>Team 2018 of Vortex NTNU consists of 21 students from seven different engineering disciplines across all years of study. We have learned a lot from last year's MATE-competition, and this year we will perform even better!</p>

    <h4>Software</h4>
    <p>The software group is responsible for developing software that makes it possible for the pilot to control the ROV in an easy, predictable, and reliable way. The responsibilities of the team include essentially all software between the inputs of the pilot, the data gathered by the sensors, and the outputs to the thrusters and manipulator arm.</p>

    <p>An estimated 6000 working hours and 71 000 NOK/9000 USD were spent building our brand new ROV, Terrapin. In June, Vortex NTNU was ready for the 2017 MATE ROV competition in Long Beach, California.</p>

    <p>Terrapin is Vortex NTNU’s second ROV (and gets its name from the shape which makes it resemble a terrapin, a small freshwater turtle). It has eight thrusters which not only contribute to Terrapin’s stunning look, but more importantly give it six degrees of freedom. In combination with the controller used for steering, this makes for a very intuitive driving experience. Four clamps are used to fasten the transparent cover which gives Terrapin its characteristic look, a design which provides easy access to the electronics aboard. Terrapin featured a new and improved camera system.</p>

    <p>Last year we had several failures in our camera system, and we wanted a more robust and reliable solution. By more than doubling the amount of cameras, Terrapin featured a total of seven cameras. This provided Terrapin with some much needed redundancy in case of a failure.</p>

    <p><h4>The Task</h4>The Port of Long Beach is one of the world’s busiest seaports. It is the second-busiest container port in the United States, after the Port of Los Angeles, which it connects to. With all of the activity and vessel traffic, the Port of Long Beach is not immune to accidents and pollution. Thousands of dollars have been spent on the removal and remediation of contaminated sites. Specifically, the port managers are in need of a robot that can: <br><ol><li>Assist with the installation of a Hyperloop system to expedite the delivery of goods and streamline commerce</li><li>Conduct maintenance on the port’s water and light show to guarantee uninterrupted entertainment</li><li>Identify and collect samples of contaminated sediment then remediate the area to protect the health of people and the environment</li><li>Identify the contents of containers that fell off of a cargo ship into the harbor and map the accident site to ensure the safety of the port and its operations</li></ol> </p>
